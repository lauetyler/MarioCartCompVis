To control Mario Kart Wii specifically (note: these controls broadly apply to other racing games as well) the following gestures are needed.  To traverse the menu, point the index finger in the four cardinal directions to move the d-pad in the corresponding direction. A balled fist represents an A press, while a fist with the thumb stuck out is a B press. Once in-game, hold two fists up as if gripping a steering wheel, with thumbs held outwards. Steering is controlled in the same manner as an actual steering wheel. To accelerate, press down on the right thumb, to brake/reverse press down on the left thumb. Lastly, to do a trick press both thumbs down and to throw an item/super push the two fists together
